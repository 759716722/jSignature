jSignature v1.0a
 
jSignature is a plugin for jQuery which simplifies the creation of a field that allows a user to enter 
a signature either via a mouse, your finger on touch enabled devices or a pen input device. 

This plugin is currently in alpha and is very much just a concept so it may not be ready for production.
